# Fake-News-Detection
Fake News Detection with Python (Machine-learning)

## What is a FakeÂ news
Fake news is news blogs, articles, or posts that are deliberately and verifiably incorrect with the sole aim to sway people's view of actual/true facts, activities, and claims.
It's about material given as news that the promoter knows to be fake, based on manifestly inaccurate facts or comments or events that did not occur.
"Fabricated material that seems to be news media content but lacks the news industry's editorial guidelines and techniques for ensuring information accuracy and trustworthiness," according to Wikipedia. Misinformation (false or misleading information) and disinformation (false or misleading information) are comparable terms (false information purposely spread to mislead people).
